## Introduction
Julia is a high-performance programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing. Its syntax is easy to learn for those familiar with Python, MATLAB, or R, and its speed rivals that of C or Fortran. These assignments uses Julia in solving mathematical problems relevant to Applied Linear Algebra.

## Installing Julia

### Step 1: Download Julia
1. Visit the [Julia official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest stable version for your operating system.

### Step 2: Install Julia
1. Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions.
2. Add Julia to your systemâ€™s PATH for easier command-line access.

### Step 3: Verify Installation
1. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt).
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   julia --version
   ```
   You should see the installed version of Julia.

## Setting Up the Environment
1. Open Julia's REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) by typing `julia` in your terminal followed by `]` to install packages.

2. Install required packages for the assignments:
   ```julia
   add("DSP")
   add("Plots")
   add("WAV")
   add("LinearAlgebra")
   add("Polynomials")
   add("Statistics")
   ```

### Navigating Julia REPL
- Enter Julia REPL by running `julia` in your terminal.
- Exit REPL: Press `Ctrl+D` or `Ctrl+Z`.
